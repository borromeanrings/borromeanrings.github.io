# borromeanrings.github.io

how to edit the website every time:
 1. clone the repo
 2. Then it can be run by `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload`. Make changes and see real-time edits.
 3. `git push origin master`. When asked the username, enter `borromeanrings`. When asked passoword, use your token, not the account's passoword.

* There must definitely be a cleaner way to not have to clone the repo every time; but my experiences showed some inconsistencies with Jekyll. I might try again some other time, but also this works good enough.
