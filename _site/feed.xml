The Lie bracket on $\mathfrak{g}$ through the adjoint representation of the group $Ad: G \to GL(\mathfrak{g})$ as $[\xi, \eta] := Ad_*(\xi)(\eta)$. Same for $\mathfrak{h}$.
The differential of $Ad$ is also usually denoted as $ad$. We want to prove that 
\(\big[d \alpha (\xi), d \alpha (\eta)\big]_{\mathfrak{h}} = d \alpha \big([\xi, \eta]_{\mathfrak{g}}\big)\).</p>

<p>Let $g_t$ and $h_s$ be parameterized paths in $G$ that represent $\xi, \eta$ respectively. We have $ \frac{\partial}{\partial s} \rvert_{s=0} \ g_t h_s g_t^{-1} = ad_{g_t}(\eta)$, and we can show $ \frac{\partial}{\partial s} \rvert_{s=0} \ g_t h_s g_t^{-1} h_s^{-1} = ad_{g_t}(\eta) - \eta$ 
since the differential of the inverse map $(g \mapsto g^{-1})$ is equal to $-1$ (differentiate $g_t g_t^{-1} =1$). Taking $ \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \rvert_{t=0}$ from the last equality we get
$ \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t \partial s} \rvert_{t=s=0} \ g_t h_s g_t^{-1} h_s^{-1} = [\xi, \eta]$.</p>

<p>Now for proving the identity, on one hand,<br />
$$ \frac{\partial}{\partial s} \big\rvert_{s=0} \alpha(g_t) \alpha(h_s) \alpha ( g_t^{-1}) \alpha( h_s^{-1}) = ad_{\alpha(g_t)}(d \alpha(\eta)) - d \alpha (\eta)$$ 
and taking $ \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \rvert_{t=0}$ we derive $[d \alpha(\xi), d \alpha(\eta)]$. On the other hand we can take the $\alpha$ in $ \frac{\partial}{\partial s} \rvert_{s=0} \ \alpha(g_t) \alpha(h_s) \alpha ( g_t^{-1}) \alpha( h_s^{-1}) = \frac{\partial}{\partial s} \rvert_{s = 0} \ \alpha \big(g_t h_s g_t^{-1} h_s^{-1} \big) $ outside of the derivative $ \frac{\partial}{\partial s} \rvert_{s = 0}$ which yields $d \alpha \big( \frac{\partial}{\partial s} \rvert_{s = 0} \ g_t h_s g_t^{-1} h_s^{-1} \big) $. Taking $ \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \rvert_{t=0}$ from the last expressions and again pushing $d \alpha$ outside of the derivative by $t$ gives
$  dd \alpha \big ( \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t \partial s} \rvert_{t = s = 0} \ g_t h_s g_t^{-1} h_s^{-1} \big) = dd \alpha \big( [\xi, \eta] \big) $; and since $d \alpha$ is linear,  $ d d \alpha = d \alpha$ and we are done.</p>

<p>Applying this to $ \alpha = Ad$ also yields the Jacobi identity for the Lie bracket.</p>]]></content><author><name>Sepehr Kooranifar</name><email>kooranifar@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Mathematics" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Donaldson had written that "it follows from the definitions", but I needed to ponder on it for a while...]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The definition of smooth structure compatibility</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2023/07/24/smoothstructure.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The definition of smooth structure compatibility" /><published>2023-07-24T12:49:21+00:00</published><updated>2023-07-24T12:49:21+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2023/07/24/smoothstructure</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2023/07/24/smoothstructure.html"><![CDATA[<p>As I was learning about galilean space-time structures (through Arnold’s <em>Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics</em>), I found things to be helpful for me to understand the meaning of compatibility of smooth structures. 
Let $M$ be a set and $\psi_1 : M \to \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^3$ be any (as wild as you wish) one-to-one and onto map. The function $\psi_1$ is then said to be defining a <em>Galilean coordinate system on $M$</em>. And a coordinate system $\psi_2$ is said to be <em>moving uniformly</em> with respect to $\psi_1$ if the map $ \psi_2 \circ \psi_1^{-1} : \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^3$ is a galilean transformation on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^3$; at which case, we say  $\psi_1$ and $\psi_2$ give $M$ the same galilean structure.</p>

<p>A Galilean transformation is easily imaginable; it can be proved to be just a combination of the rotation of the inertial observer, and uniform movement of him/her with a fixed velocity vector, and an adjustment in our clock. These transformations are the ones that are irrelevant to the physical phenomena that is happening. That is to say, $\psi_1$ and $\psi_2$ are <em>assigning</em> the same physical structure to $M$ (time function is the same, the distance function for the simultaneous events is the same, etc.). An example of a galilean structure that is not the same as $\psi_1$ is a map that first applies $\psi_1$ itself, and then stretches the time coordinate by a factor of $2$; name this map $\psi_3$. To see that $\psi_3$ is not the same structure as $\psi_1$, consider the inverse image of the time axis of $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^3$, i.e. $T = \psi_1^{-1} \big( \mathrm{span} (1, 0, \dots, 0) \big)$; also we have $T = \psi_3^{-1} \big( \mathrm{span} (1, 0, \dots, 0) \big)$. Moving along $T$ (which is the piece of $M$ that is meant to encode passage of time at the origin of space), and watching the images by $\psi_1$ and $\psi_3$, we can see that time passes with double-speed in $\psi_3(M)$ compared to $\psi_1(M)$. Therefore, the structures that $\psi_1$ and $\psi_3$ define on $M$ are different as space-time structures.</p>

<p>Same is the story in the theory of smooth manifolds. Say $X$ is a two-dimensional manifold and $p$ be a point in $X$. If $(U, \varphi_1)$ and $(V, \varphi_2)$ are charts about $p$, we call the two charts compatible if the map $\varphi_2 \circ \varphi_1^{-1}: \varphi_1 (U \cap V) \to \varphi_2 (U \cap V)$ is a diffeomorphism. We may confine our attention to $U \cap V$, because this is the place where talking about compatibility is more meaningful. Just like above, the maps $\varphi_1$ and $\varphi_2$ are assigning the smooth structure of $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $X$ in their own way. An analogue example of the incompatible structures above could be the following: Let $X = \mathbb{R}^2$ and suppose $L$ is the graph of the absolute value function residing in $X$. Suppose $\varphi_1$ is the identity map, and $\varphi_2(L)$ is a straight line in $\mathbb{R}^2$; then $L$ with the structure coming from $\varphi_1$ is considering $L$ as a non-smooth curve, but with the structure from $\varphi_2$, it is actually a smooth curve in $X$. Here, diffeomorphisms are picked to be the group of maps that mod out all the differences that are unimportant from a differentiable viewpoint (just like the way that galilean transformations group helped us dismiss rotations, clock changes and uniform motion of the observer). Therefore, the diffeomorphism group (along with the galilean transformation group in the above scenario) is <em>defining</em> insignificant differences; whatever difference that cannot be removed by applying a member of the group, is considered as a real difference between the structures. Like in our example, if $\gamma$ is any diffeomorphism of $\mathbb{R}^2$, then $\gamma \circ \varphi_1(L) = \gamma (L)$ will still have the edge-point and cannot be equal to a straight line, so $\varphi_1$ cannot become $\varphi_2$ by means of an unimportant change (i.e. a diffeomorphism like $\gamma$), hence these structures are different.</p>

<!-- 
A _Galilean space-time structure_ consists of the following:

- The universe: A four-dimensional affine space $A^4$. Where point of $A^4$ are called _world points_ or _events_.
- Time: a linear map $t: \mathbb{R}^4 \to \mathbb{R}$ from the vector space of parallel displacements of $A^4$ to the real ''time axis'' (so the time interval between two points $a,b \in A^4$ is $t(a-b)$).
- A distance function between simultaneous events: a function $\rho : A^3 \times A^3 \to \mathbb{R}$ which comes from a scalar product on the space $\mathbb{R}^3$. The value $\rho(a,b)$ is defined only if the events $a,b$ belong to a same time (i.e. $a-b$ belongs to the kernel of the time map $t$).

In order to capture the notion of inertial observer, _Galilean transformations_ are defined, which are affine transformations on the universe that preserve the time $t$ and the simultaneous distance function $\rho$.

As an example, the space $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^3$ has a natural Galilean structure: consider it as an affine space, and let the map $t$ be projection along the first coordinate, and define $\rho$ to be the usual euclidean distance on $\mathbb{R}^3$.  An illuminating example of a Galilean transformation in this case is $g: \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^3$ with $(t, \mathbf{x}) \mapsto (t, \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{v}t)$; it must be thought of as the same structure $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^3$ but that the observer is having a uniform motion with the velocity vector $-\mathbf{v}$. Other examples of Galilean transformations are $ (t, \mathbf{x}) \mapsto (t+s, \mathbf{x})$ (an adjustment in our clock), and $(t, \mathbf{x}) \mapsto (t, G \mathbf{x})$ where $G$ is an orthogonal matrix (this is just a rotation of the observer in the 3-space). Also, let us just accept that it is provable that all of the Galilean transformations on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^3$ are combination of the three mentioned transformations, and also that every Galilean structure is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^3$. So we can take any Galilean structure as _the_ canonical one; we will just stick with $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^3$. -->]]></content><author><name>Sepehr Kooranifar</name><email>kooranifar@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Mathematics" /><category term="Manifold Theory" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Say $X$ is a manifold and $p$ is a point in $M$.

As writing down everything is time-consuming, I will only be mentioning some technicalities that interest me, but will provide the main ideas of other parts as well, so that these posts still have a form of progress through the theorem.</p>

<p>Why $h$-cobordism? I was first interested in the topic when I found out that it was used by Smale to prove the $n$-dimensional topological Poincare conjecture for all $n \geq 5$. It is interesting that cases $n=3,4$ were proved much later using sophisticated techniques (I will surely remark on where Smale’s argument breaks for $n=3,4$ in later posts). The situation is contrary to our idea that working in higher dimensions seem to be harder. This got me more interested in low-dimensional topology as well.</p>

<p>Also I got interested in the $h$-cobordism as I intended to understand <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floer_homology">Floer homology</a>. Floer homology is said to be (and I still don’t know why) the infinite-dimensional analogue of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_theory">Morse theory</a>. The $h$-cobordism theorem makes a fair use of Morse theory. So for me, $h$-cobordism has been appealing on its own, and also in line with further interests.</p>

<p>I will mainly be going through <a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/surgery/hcobord.pdf">Milnor’s <em>Lectures on the $h$-cobordism theorem</em></a>, but not sure exactly for now; hopefully I will later provide a suggested reading plan for interested readers, having done some trial-and-error.</p>

<p>I will end this post with the statement of the theorem. Let $W$ be a compact smooth manifold having two boundary components $V$ and $V’$ such that $V$ and $V’$ are both deformation retracts of $W$. Then $W$ is said to be an <em>$h$-cobordism</em> between $V$ and $V’$. The $h$-cobordism theorem states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If $V$ and (hence) $V’$ are simply connected and of dimension greater than 4, then $W$ is diffeomorphic to $V \times [0,1]$, and (consequently) $V$ is diffeomorphic to $V’$.</p>

<p>Beside the essential beauty of the work of art above, some relevance to it could be found by the end of this discussion.</p>

<p>The Continuum Hypothesis (denoted by \(\mathsf{CH}\) from now on) is the following claim:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There exists no cardinal number between the cardinal of natural numbers and that of real numbers. Equivalently, every uncountable subset of real numbers has the power of the continuum.</p>
</blockquote>

<!--more-->

<p>Continuum hypothesis was advanced by Georg Cantor in 1878, and establishing its truth or falsehood is the first of Hilbert’s famous 23 problems presented in 1900. Many mathematicians tried to settle this question, but for a while, no one couldn’t find a counter-example subset of reals, either couldn’t prove \(\mathsf{CH}\). The culmination of over 80 years of mathematical endeavor  illuminated that, \(\mathsf{CH}\)’s truth value, in the sense that would be discussed in the following paragraphs, is independent of the world of mathematics.</p>

<p>What is meant by “world of mathematics” is technically “a model of \(\mathsf{ZFC}\)”. As you know, \(\mathsf{ZFC}\) is a set of propositions in a first-order logic language. Considering a set like \(M\), any of the propositions in \(\mathsf{ZFC}\) may or may not hold in \(M\). For example, let \(M_0 =\{ \varnothing , \{ \{ \varnothing \}\} \}\). Then \(M_0\) does not satisfy the power set axiom, in the sense that \(A = \{ \{ \varnothing \}\}\) is a member of \(M_0\) but its power set \(\mathcal{P}(A) = \{ \varnothing,  \{ \{ \varnothing \}\}\}\) is not a member of \(M_0\). Also, axiom of extentionality does not hold in \(M_0\): for a proposed \(M\), this axiom states,
$$ \forall A,B \in M \Big[ \big( \forall x \in M \ (x \in A \leftrightarrow x \in B)  \big) \to A=B \Big].$$</p>

<p>Which means that given any members \(A\) and \(B\) of \(M\), if for every \(x\) (in \(M\)), \(x\) is either in non of \(A\) and \(B\) or is in both of them, then \(A\) is equal to \(B\). Taking \(A = \varnothing\) and \(B = \{ \{ \varnothing \}\}\), every member of \(M_0\) is in \(A\) if and only if it’s in \(B\), but \(A \neq B\); therefore extensionality is failing. An entity \(M\) is called a <em>model of \(\mathsf{ZFC}\)</em> if all of \(\mathsf{ZFC}\) axioms hold in \(M\). So we’ve seen that \(M_0\) is actually not a model of \(\mathsf{ZFC}\) i.e. is not an appropriate universe where these axioms hold.</p>

<p>So a question would be that in what sense do we call some model of \(\mathsf{ZFC}\), world of mathematics? The ultimate goal of the foundationalist movement was to set a grounding upon which mathematics could be built. \(\mathsf{ZFC}\) set theory was a such grounding proposed by Zermelo and Fraenkel and was widely regarded as the best one. It was shown that one can develop a large portion of mathematics (e.g. nearly all of the undergraduate-level mathematics) in a \(\mathsf{ZFC}\) set-theoretic universe. So in this sense, one can regard a model of \(\mathsf{ZFC}\) as “world of mathematics”; but one should be cautious about assigning more meaning to this phrase than what is said.</p>

<p>Does there exist any model of \(\mathsf{ZFC}\) at all? A common <em>belief</em>  is that \(\mathsf{ZFC}\) is consistent [For a discussion see <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/belaxioms1.pdf">this</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/belaxioms2.pdf">this</a> article by Penelope Maddy]; under this presumption (which we shall maintain in this discussion), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_completeness_theorem">completeness theorem</a> implies the existence of models of \(\mathsf{ZFC}\). Now there were two major achievements. First, Gödel proved that there exists a model of \(\mathsf{ZFC} + \mathsf{CH}\) (which means that \(\mathsf{ZFC}\) cannot disprove \(\mathsf{CH}\), because otherwise \(\mathsf{ZFC} + \mathsf{CH}\) is inconsistent and by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundness">soundess theorem</a> it couldn’t have had a model); he introduced the notion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructible_universe">constructible universe</a> to provide the proof. And second, Cohen managed to prove that there exists a model of \(\mathsf{ZFC} + \neg \mathsf{CH}\) (similarly meaning that \(\mathsf{ZFC}\) cannot prove \(\mathsf{CH}\)); his seminal work introduced a powerful technique called <em>forcing</em>. Combining these two results, \(\mathsf{CH}\) is independent of \(\mathsf{ZFC}\). \(\mathsf{CH}\) is not unique in being independent of \(\mathsf{ZFC}\); many other statements have been proved to be independent of \(\mathsf{ZFC}\) (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_statements_independent_of_ZFC">here</a> is a list of such statements from various areas of mathematics).</p>

<p>From this point on, it is more to the question that what does even mean to ask about the truthness of \(\mathsf{CH}\). Accordingly, we can divide mathematics in two, where one is those mathematics (theories) in which \(\mathsf{CH}\) holds, and the other is those where it doesn’t hold. A view on the situation is Platonism, which is the one we employ in this discussion [among the opposing views, to my knowledge, Intuitionism is the most modern and has many advocates]. In this view, the set of real numbers exists as an abstract entity and is independent of us; and if we were (are(?)) able to grab each of its subsets, we can evaluate if their cardinality is \(\aleph_0\) or \(2^{\aleph_0}\) or is in between; and after considering the cardinality of all of the subsets we have genuinely achieved the truth value of \(\mathsf{CH}\). A platonist’s justification for independence of \(\mathsf{CH}\) from \(\mathsf{ZFC}\) is that \(\mathsf{ZFC}\) axioms are just not enough strong and interpretative to explain many “realities”. To a Platonist, this situation is pretty similar to the one following: The theory \(\mathsf{ZFC} - \mathsf{P}\) (\(\mathsf{ZFC}\) with the axiom of power set \(\mathsf{P}\) excluded) is independent of \(\mathsf{P}\). So although its theorems are true, it is certainly missing the clear “reality” that the power set of every set exists.</p>

<h2 id="gödels-program">Gödel’s Program</h2>

<p>As a next step, it is plausible to attempt to extend our best theory (\(\mathsf{ZFC}\)) by adding new <em>justified</em> statements to it, in order to increase the interpretative power. In this way, we might get a chance to derive a <em>sound</em> theory, of which \(\mathsf{CH}\) is not independent and has its “real” truth value in the theory. This attempt is Gödel’s Program. And it occupies a great amount of research that is being done in modern set theory. The theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_cardinal">large cardinals</a> plays a key role here, but to keep it short, I shall refer to <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~steel/papers/godelsprogrampub.pdf">this</a> article by Steel for more discussion on relations with large cardinals.</p>

<p>Now there’s an incredible phenomenon that set theorists have noticed, which is pertinent to this discussion and we can now talk about.</p>

<h2 id="hierarchy-of-consistency-strength">Hierarchy of consistency strength</h2>

<p>Considering <em>natural</em> (with a specific technical meaning) extensions of \(\mathsf{ZFC}\), one can define a partial order on them in the following way. If \(U\) and \(T\) are two such extensions, let \(U \leq_{\mathrm{Con}} T\) denote that consistency of \(T\) implies consistency of \(U\) (in this case we would say \(T\) has more consistency strength than \(U\)). For a considerable number of such extensions, it has been shown that if \(T\) has more consistency strength than \(U\) then all of the theorems of \(U\) are also theorems of \(T\), and so \(T\) is extending the theory of \(U\).</p>

<p>Now the phenomenon is that, taking any pair of natural extensions of \(\mathsf{ZFC}\), they are comparable with the order \(\leq_{\mathrm{Con}}\). Therefore \(\leq_{\mathrm{Con}}\) seems to be a linear order. Which remarkably means that natural extensions of \(\mathsf{ZFC}\) come together as a stairway, each of them extending the theory of the previous ones. So if we want to keep extending \(\mathsf{ZFC}\) justifiably, the hierarchy of consistency strength suggests that there’s only one way upward; the way that seemingly is guiding us to the ultimate goal of the quest, i.e., reality.</p>]]></content><author><name>Sepehr Kooranifar</name><email>kooranifar@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Mathematics" /><category term="Set Theory" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Continuum Hypothesis (denoted by $ \mathsf{CH}$ from now on) is the following claim.
