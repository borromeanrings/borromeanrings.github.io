Welcome to this blog. My name is Sepehr (/Mohammad Mehdi) Kooranifar and currently Iâ€™m a master's student at Sharif University of Technology majoring in mathematics. I'm interested in geometry and logic. 

This blog is meant to be the realm of my musings --mathematics and other facets of our existence.

<!-- Also if you, are a student too, I would like to encourage creating your own blog. Here [some link] I fully described how this blog is set up, so that you can make one alike if you wish. -->

The painting on the homepage is _The Wilderness_ by Sanford Robin Gifford.

Hope the writings bring you pleasure and delight.
