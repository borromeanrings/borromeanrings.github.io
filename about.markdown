Hello and welcome to this blog. My name is Mohammad Mahdi Kooranifar and Iâ€™m an undergraduate student at the university of Tehran majoring in mathematics. I'm interested in logics and geometry. Here I post about topics related to mathematics and other things that I find important or interesting.

My email is ``[mylastname][atsign]ut.ac.ir`` if you would like to contact me.

<!-- Also if you, are a student too, I would like to encourage creating your own blog. Here [some link] I fully described how this blog is set up, so that you can make one alike if you wish. -->

The painting on the homepage is _The Wilderness_ by Sanford Robin Gifford.

Hope you enjoy!
