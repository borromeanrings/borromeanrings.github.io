# borromeanrings.github.io

how to edit the website every time:
 1. clone the repo
 2. Then it can be run by `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload`. Make changes and see real-time edits.
 3. `git push origin master`. When asked for the username, enter `borromeanrings`. When asked for the password, use your token, not the account's password.

* As long as everything is pushed, the local repo will be in sync with github, unless some changes are made to the github repo without the local files, at which case we should pull changes before making edits and pushing.
