I"<p>Welcome to this blog. My name is Sepehr (/Mohammad Mehdi) Kooranifar and I’m an undergraduate student at the university of Tehran majoring in mathematics. I’m interested in geometry and logic.</p>

<p>This blog is meant to be the realm of my musings –mathematics and other facets of our existence that I hold dear.</p>

<!-- My email is ``[mylastname][atsign]gmail.com`` if you would like to contact me. -->

<!-- Also if you, are a student too, I would like to encourage creating your own blog. Here [some link] I fully described how this blog is set up, so that you can make one alike if you wish. -->

<p>The painting that graces the homepage is <em>The Wilderness</em> by Sanford Robin Gifford.</p>

<p>Hope some of the writings bring you pleasure and delight.</p>
